## Unsolved Problems
* When a user logouts and the page is redirected to the authorization page the user's task is still displayed on the page. 
* Hitting errors when I attempt to check a task off indicating that it is complete. 

## Future Advancements
 Focus App 2.0 
 
 * Sync To-Do list with family, friends, and team
 * Add calendar API
 * User needs to be able to organize to do list into categories
 * User needs to change color of task depending on level of importance. Ex:Red for URGENT!
 * Continue improving UI and UX based on UX research to make more user friend
